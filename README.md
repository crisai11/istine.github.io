# My love, 

In our journey through life, you’ve been with me on both ups and downs. You've been my partner, we are discovering new places, and taking steps toward our dreams. I’m grateful for the simple things, our laughters, our conversations during walks, and the moments we celebrate together. Every time that we are together, I feel the completeness of our relationship.

I don’t know how to fully express my gratitude, but one thing is for sure, you are one of the most valuable and beautiful part of my life. Through trials and hopes, mistakes and acceptance, I’m here for you, but not just as a partner, but as friend. So as each day passes, as the sun sets and a new morning dawns, I want you to know that you matter. I love you, my love. And as time goes by, may we continue this journey together. Take care always, I hope you’re doing well. I will always be here, ready to listen and offer support. i love you so much!
